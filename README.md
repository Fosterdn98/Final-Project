# Final-Project

The Gaming Room is a company that is looking to develope a game that is simular to the old game "Draw it or Lose is". They are looking to support multiple users using a large array of platforms and OS. They are looking to have the game developed to support users on all major types of devices such as Mobile, Computer, Laptop, Tablet. Using a range of differnt oporating systems Examples being MacOs, IOS, Windows, Linux. I took a deep dive into the understandings of the requests and expectations that the Gaming Room had requested and compiled all my findings into a Software Design Document. This document shows the different struggeles and hurtles that would need to be tackles in order to make a game as requested. I belive that by having a Software Design Document it helps to lay out for both the developer and the client the struggle and hurtles that will need to be over taken in order to complete the project. I think that this document does this in a way that is easyy to understand and mantaine. It is my opinion that a area of improvment in the document that i have made would be the Design Constraints i think that it could have been further expanded upon and more could have been added had there be more detail and requirements.
